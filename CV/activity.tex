\begin{rubric}{Activity and research interests}\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
My research activity is placed in the wide discipline of statistical mechanics methods for complex systems analysis, in particular concerning spin-glass theory and its application to modern Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The core research interest consists in the development of rigorous mathematical techniques, involving in particular Guerra's interpolating schemes, non-linear PDE theory, probability and statistics and random matrix theory. My research interests also cover the application of statistical inference tools to real-world (in particular, biological) problems.
